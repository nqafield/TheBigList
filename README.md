# The Big List
This is the list I wish I'd started ages ago.

(The name is more anticipatory than strictly accurate.)

Please [comment](https://gist.github.com/pa9ey/6225e00469eb8fd8925ab18076e06319).

# Critical Few
*This will not be an immutable list.*
* [The Future of Programming - Bret Victor](https://vimeo.com/71278954)
  * Why does it matter?
    * I keep coming back to this talk. It's genius in so many ways.
    * It's a fantastic "conceit", very well presented. (The only thing better - from this point of view - that comes to mind is "Growing a Language". Coincidentally - I assume - both these talks feature acetates and OHPs, but for slightly different reasons.)
  * Inspirational, Fundamental, History
* [How to Write a Method - Kevlin Henney](https://vimeo.com/74316116)

# Real OO?
*The idea that there is a genuine concept of Object Oriented Programming out there somewhere - which most of us have missed - is intriguing and sometimes infuriating. Enjoy!*
* [A Taste of Trygve - James Coplien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjd0IB_8xD8)
