# The Big List
This is the list I wish I'd started ages ago.

(The name is more anticipatory than strictly accurate.)

Please [comment](https://gist.github.com/pa9ey/6225e00469eb8fd8925ab18076e06319).

## TL;DR - Give me a quick taster...
* [Code in the Language of the Domain - Dan North](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Code_in_the_Language_of_the_Domain)
* [Seeing Spaces - Bret Victor](https://vimeo.com/97903574)

# Critical few
*This will not be an immutable list.*
* [The Future of Programming - Bret Victor](https://vimeo.com/71278954)
  * Why does it matter?
    * I keep coming back to this talk. It's genius in so many ways.
    * It's a fantastic "conceit", very well presented. (The only<sup name="super">[1](#footnote)</sup> thing better - from this point of view - that comes to mind is "Growing a Language". Coincidentally - I assume - both these talks feature acetates and OHPs, but for slightly different reasons.)
  * Inspirational, Fundamental, History
* [How to Write a Method - Kevlin Henney](https://vimeo.com/74316116)
  * Why does it matter?
    * Questions the basics of coding style and posits the idea that style is often not as subjective as we like to think it is.
    * That feeling when you figured you knew this already but had no idea how to explain it or justify it...
    * “It turns out that style matters in programming for the same reason that it matters in writing. It makes for better reading.” - Doug Crockford
  * Provocative

# My current project defaults
*Any project, of any reasonable size, in my current context, this is roughly where I'm coming from...*

* [TDD, where did it all go wrong? - Ian Cooper](https://vimeo.com/68375232)

* [Why I've Come to Prefer Fluent APIs Over Other Kinds of DSLs - John Slaby](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/dsl-fluent-api)

# Real OO?
*The idea that there is a genuine concept of Object Oriented Programming out there somewhere - which most of us have missed - is intriguing and sometimes infuriating. Enjoy!*
