# The Big List
This is the list I wish I'd started ages ago.

(The name is more anticipatory than strictly accurate.)

Please [comment](https://gist.github.com/nqafield/6225e00469eb8fd8925ab18076e06319).

# **Announcement**
I'm thinking the focus of this list should change.

Part of the original premise was that it might be a small help in pointing people in the right direction and perhaps starting a "conversation" (by which I mean, of course, a debate) that perhaps would help some people (primarily myself) learn a few things, mostly about software. Unfortunately I've ~recently discovered~ become increasingly aware that humanity (or, at least, the vast majority of the software community) appears to have completely forgotten how to think and debate. And since I don't trust my own ideas one bit, unless I can back them up with objective rational argument (you know, on account of me not being an arrogant narcissist), then I didn't want to risk misleading naive people into further avenues of nonsense.

It occurs to me that there is perhaps no greater level of arrogance (on an ordinary every-day scale) than someone imagining that their pronouncements on objective matters of fact should be listened to and accepted without challenge - and their challengers silenced. So, naturally, I want to avoid that. But if people really have forgotten how to think (and therefore can't rationally challenge me), then you can see I have a dilemma...

So maybe the first goal of this list should be to attempt to point people in the direction of anything that might re-ignite their desire for the lost art of reason, and then they can hopefully start showing me where I'm wrong.

**NB**: If I have said anything at all - even the tiniest jot or tittle - that is incorrect (either softwarily or otherwise), then please, by all means, come at me. ASAP. I'm here waiting. And you're welcome [here](https://gist.github.com/nqafield/6225e00469eb8fd8925ab18076e06319). I want to be corrected.

In the meantime, watch out for the new list.

## Thoughts
* What I realise I've probably been reacting (so violently) to is the decaying stench of Postmodernism.
* "Postmodernism? Really? Isn't that a bit heavy for software development?"
  * In a sense, this isn't just about software development. But even so, software, in most contexts, is largely about people and their assumptions and attitudes; relationships; communication; etc. And, increasingly, about politics and "activism" rather than just tech. So these things are unavoidable even here.

  * Why does it matter?
    * I keep coming back to this talk. It's genius in so many ways.
    * It's a fantastic "conceit", very well presented. (The only<sup name="super1">[1](#footnote1)</sup> thing better - from this point of view - that comes to mind is "Growing a Language". Coincidentally - I assume - both these talks feature acetates and OHPs, but for slightly different reasons.)

  * Why does it matter?
    * Questions the basics of coding style and posits the idea that style is often not as subjective as we like to think it is.
    * That feeling when you figured you knew this already but had no idea how to explain it or justify it...
    * “It turns out that style matters in programming for the same reason that it matters in writing. It makes for better reading.” - Doug Crockford
  * Provocative
